# uus corp ui

Uus Corp UI is a rewrite of the Default UI for Ultima Online's Enhanced Client. Its goals are to make the UI easier to mode and look more like UO.

**Status:**

The UI is not ready to be used. I am still grappling with the core dysfunction of the existing UI and laying foundations.

Below is a table that descibes each functional area's status. If a feature from the Default UI is not listed, it has not been reckoned with.

As I have determined that I cannot simply tweak the existing code and must rewrite everything, if a feature is not listed here, then that feature simply does not exist in the UI yet and will not function.


| Feature          | Description                      | Status      |
|------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
|   Backpack    |   |   |
|   Chat    |   Chat window with channels   |   |
|   Debug Window     | Logs debug output        | Done |
|   Main Menu Window | Presents menu options via escape | Done |
|   Paperdoll   |   |   |
|   Player Status | Show player hp, mp, stam  |   |
|   Resize Window  | Resizes the game window | Removed |
|   Vendor Search   |   |   |

**Disclaimer:**

I am not a fan of the Enhanced Client. I am not a fan of Lua. I do not trust anything about the Default UI. If you want to have the best experience in UO, you should use one of the many third-party applications that extend the capabilities of the Classic Client.
