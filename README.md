# uus corp ui
 
Uus Corp UI is a mod for Ultima Online's Enhanced Client. Its goals are:

* Refactor all UI to follow a more object-oriented design pattern.
* Remove all bloated, bug-ridden features from the default UI.
* Remove all ugly UI components.
* Re-design the UI to fit the fantasy theme.

The mod's guiding principles are:

* Make the UI easier to mod.
* Make the UI look more like UO.
* Make the UI intuitive.

Current phase: The mod is still in early phases. 
I am currently refactoring all modules and cleaning up code.

Disclaimer: I'm not a fan of the Enhanced Client or the lua language. I don't trust the client or the default UI codebase. To that end, I'm basing what I'd like to see from the client more on Classic Client re-implementations than on the Enhanced Client itself, so you're going to see a lot of things removed. Wherever I've removed things, I've asked the following questions:

* Is it buggy?
* Does it really add value, or does it just add noise?
* If not having it was good enough for the Classic Client, do we really need it?
